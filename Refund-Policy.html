        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

        <div class="section">
           
            <p>1. Tickets purchased at Roccia Hill Resort & Adventure Park are non-refundable.</p>

               <p> 2. Guests seen tampering with the bands may be removed from the premises immediately. Tickets/bands are
                only valid for the day of purchase.</p>

            <p>3. If a guest is unable to complete all of the activities for any reason, personal or otherwise, tickets
                may be extended at the discretion of Roccia Hill Resort & Adventure Park management.</p>

            <p>4. If a customer purchases a membership online or in person, the membership is non-transferable and
                non-cancelable. In its place, no redundancies or revisions will be made. Before purchasing a membership,
                read the park's membership terms and conditions carefully.</p>

            <p>5. If you have a problem during the payment process or if your payment is declined, please contact your
                bank for more information.</p>

            <p>6. Although we cannot issue refunds, in the event of the Park closure, your time may be extended if
                slots are available that day, or a rain check will be issued for a future trip.</p>
